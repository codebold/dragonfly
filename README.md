Dragonfly (neo2)
============================================================================

Enhanced Dragonfly that works with a neo2 keyboard layout. The main difference is the introduction of two new modifier keys for the layers 3 and 4 of the neo2 keyboard layout. It will break the functionality when used together with any other keyboard layout! It is indeed a bad and ugly hack (, but it works...).

Trying to keep it in sync with the [original Dragonfly repository](https://github.com/t4ngo/dragonfly).
